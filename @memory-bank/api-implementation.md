# RESTful API Implementation with Huma Framework

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive RESTful API using the Huma framework with proper endpoint design, authentication, and OpenAPI documentation to serve as the backend for the trading bot dashboard.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backtest Endpoints
- Created endpoint for running a backtest (`POST /api/v1/backtest`)
- Created endpoint for getting backtest results (`GET /api/v1/backtest/{id}`)
- Created endpoint for listing all backtests (`GET /api/v1/backtest/list`)
- Created endpoint for comparing backtests (`POST /api/v1/backtest/compare`)

### 2. Strategy Management Endpoints
- Created endpoint for listing available strategies (`GET /api/v1/strategy`)
- Created endpoint for getting strategy details (`GET /api/v1/strategy/{id}`)
- Created endpoint for updating strategy configuration (`PUT /api/v1/strategy/{id}`)
- Created endpoints for enabling/disabling strategies (`POST /api/v1/strategy/{id}/enable`, `POST /api/v1/strategy/{id}/disable`)

### 3. Authentication Endpoints
- Created endpoint for user login (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`)
- Created endpoint for user registration (`POST /api/v1/auth/register`)
- Created endpoint for token refresh (`POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`)
- Created endpoint for user logout (`POST /api/v1/auth/logout`)
- Created endpoint for token verification (`GET /api/v1/auth/verify`)

### 4. User Management Endpoints
- Created endpoint for getting user profile (`GET /api/v1/user/profile`)
- Created endpoint for updating user profile (`PUT /api/v1/user/profile`)
- Created endpoint for getting user settings (`GET /api/v1/user/settings`)
- Created endpoint for updating user settings (`PUT /api/v1/user/settings`)
- Created endpoint for changing password (`POST /api/v1/user/password`)

## Implementation Details
- Used a modular approach with separate packages for each endpoint group
- Created reusable models for various data structures
- Implemented proper validation for all request parameters
- Added comprehensive OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
- Followed TDD approach by writing tests first, then implementing the code
- Created comprehensive tests for all endpoints

## Next Steps
- Implement the actual handlers for these endpoints
- Connect the API to the business logic of the trading bot
- Add authentication middleware to secure the API
- Implement integration with the frontend
- Create integration tests for the API endpoints
