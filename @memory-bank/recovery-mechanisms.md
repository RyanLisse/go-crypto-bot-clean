# Recovery Mechanisms and Authentication Flow Integration

## Overview
Implemented robust recovery mechanisms and integrated them with the authentication flow to enhance system reliability and resilience.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Recovery Middleware
- Improved the existing `RecoveryMiddleware` to handle authentication-specific panics
- Added detailed context information to recovery logs
- Implemented proper error responses for recovered panics
- Added support for configuration options

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implemented `CircuitBreaker` to prevent cascading failures
- Added states: Closed (normal operation), Open (rejecting requests), Half-Open (testing recovery)
- Implemented automatic recovery and retry logic
- Added configuration options for failure thresholds and timeouts

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- Implemented `GracefulDegradation` for handling service degradation
- Added support for different service modes: Normal, Read-Only, Maintenance
- Implemented automatic recovery based on error counts
- Added path-based rules for critical and read-only operations

### 4. Integration with Authentication Flow
- Connected recovery mechanisms to the authentication middleware
- Added proper error propagation through the middleware chain
- Enhanced error detection for authentication-specific issues
- Implemented user context preservation during recovery

## Benefits
- Improved system resilience during high load or service disruptions
- Better user experience during partial outages
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed error context
- Automatic recovery from temporary failures
- Protection against cascading failures
