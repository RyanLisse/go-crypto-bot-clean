# Strategy API Implementation with Huma Framework

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive RESTful API for strategy management using the Huma framework with proper endpoint design, validation, and OpenAPI documentation. Created a modular structure with separate packages for each endpoint group.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Strategy Endpoints
- Created endpoint for listing available strategies (`GET /api/v1/strategy`)
- Created endpoint for getting strategy details (`GET /api/v1/strategy/{id}`)
- Created endpoint for updating strategy configuration (`PUT /api/v1/strategy/{id}`)
- Created endpoints for enabling/disabling strategies (`POST /api/v1/strategy/{id}/enable`, `POST /api/v1/strategy/{id}/disable`)

### 2. Strategy Models
- Created models for strategy parameters, performance metrics, and configuration
- Implemented proper validation for strategy parameters
- Added comprehensive documentation for all models

### 3. Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for all strategy endpoints
- Followed TDD approach by writing tests first, then implementing the code
- Verified that all endpoints return the expected responses

## Implementation Details
- Used a modular approach with separate packages for each endpoint group
- Created reusable models for strategy parameters and performance metrics
- Implemented proper validation for all request parameters
- Added comprehensive OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints

## Next Steps
- Implement the actual handlers for these endpoints
- Connect the API to the strategy implementation
- Add authentication middleware to secure the API
- Create integration tests for the API endpoints
