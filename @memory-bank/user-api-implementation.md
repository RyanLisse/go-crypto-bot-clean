# User Management API Implementation with Huma Framework

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive RESTful API for user management using the Huma framework with proper endpoint design, validation, and OpenAPI documentation. Created a modular structure with separate packages for each endpoint group.

## Components Implemented

### 1. User Profile Endpoints
- Created endpoint for getting user profile (`GET /api/v1/user/profile`)
- Created endpoint for updating user profile (`PUT /api/v1/user/profile`)

### 2. User Settings Endpoints
- Created endpoint for getting user settings (`GET /api/v1/user/settings`)
- Created endpoint for updating user settings (`PUT /api/v1/user/settings`)

### 3. Password Management Endpoints
- Created endpoint for changing password (`POST /api/v1/user/password`)

### 4. User Models
- Created models for user information and settings
- Implemented proper validation for user requests
- Added comprehensive documentation for all models

### 5. Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for all user management endpoints
- Followed TDD approach by writing tests first, then implementing the code
- Verified that all endpoints return the expected responses

## Implementation Details
- Used a modular approach with separate packages for each endpoint group
- Created reusable models for user information and settings
- Implemented proper validation for all request parameters
- Added comprehensive OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints

## Next Steps
- Implement the actual handlers for these endpoints
- Connect the API to the user management service
- Add authentication middleware to secure the API
- Implement password hashing and validation
- Create integration tests for the API endpoints
