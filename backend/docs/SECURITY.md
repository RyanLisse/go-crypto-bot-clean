# Security Guide for Crypto Bot Backend

This document outlines security best practices and configurations for deploying the Crypto Bot backend to production environments.

## Environment Variables and Secrets

All sensitive information should be stored as environment variables, not hardcoded in the application:

1. **API Keys**: MEXC API keys, AI provider keys, and other service credentials
2. **Database Credentials**: TursoDB connection strings and auth tokens
3. **JWT Secret**: Used for authentication token signing

### Managing Secrets

- Use `.env.template` as a reference but never commit actual secrets to version control
- For production, use a secrets management solution like:
  - Docker secrets
  - Kubernetes secrets
  - HashiCorp Vault
  - Cloud provider secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager)

## API Security

The backend implements several security measures:

1. **JWT Authentication**: All protected endpoints require a valid JWT token
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting request frequency
3. **CORS Configuration**: Controls which domains can access the API
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
5. **API Keys**: External API access requires valid API keys

## Database Security

TursoDB security considerations:

1. **Authentication**: Always use auth tokens for database access
2. **Connection Security**: Use encrypted connections
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups are essential
4. **Data Validation**: All data is validated before storage

## Deployment Security

When deploying to production:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always enable SSL/TLS for all traffic
2. **Non-root User**: The Docker container runs as a non-root user
3. **Minimal Image**: The production image contains only necessary components
4. **Health Checks**: Regular health checks ensure system integrity
5. **Firewall Rules**: Limit access to only required ports and IP ranges

## Secure Configuration

The `config.production.yaml` file includes production-ready security settings:

1. **Content Security Policy**: Restricts resource loading
2. **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
3. **X-XSS-Protection**: Helps prevent cross-site scripting
4. **Strict Transport Security**: Enforces HTTPS usage
5. **Referrer Policy**: Controls information in HTTP referrer header

## Regular Updates

Keep the system secure by:

1. Regularly updating dependencies
2. Applying security patches promptly
3. Monitoring for security advisories
4. Conducting periodic security reviews

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. Immediately rotate all affected credentials
2. Document the incident and response
3. Analyze root causes
4. Implement preventive measures

## Monitoring and Logging

Security monitoring includes:

1. Logging all authentication attempts
2. Monitoring for unusual API usage patterns
3. Alerting on suspicious activities
4. Regular log reviews

## Compliance

Ensure compliance with relevant regulations:

1. Data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
2. Financial regulations for crypto trading
3. API usage terms of service

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

- [ ] All secrets are properly managed
- [ ] SSL/TLS is properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] CORS is configured correctly
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique
- [ ] Non-root user is used in containers
- [ ] Security headers are enabled
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Firewall rules are in place
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are configured
