# Go Crypto Bot Implementation Overview

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

### Core Modules
- `internal/domain/models`: Data models for the trading system
- `internal/mexc`: MEXC exchange-specific implementations
- `internal/core`: Core business logic
- `internal/database`: Database interactions
- `pkg/ratelimiter`: Rate limiting utilities

### WebSocket Client Implementation

#### Key Features
- Robust WebSocket connection management
- Thread-safe connection state handling
- Real-time market data streaming
- Automatic reconnection and error handling
- Ticker subscription mechanism

#### Implemented Capabilities
- RWMutex-based concurrency control
- Explicit connection state tracking
- Ping/pong message processing
- Ticker data subscription
- Exponential backoff reconnection strategy
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Concurrency and Thread Safety
- Use of RWMutex for fine-grained locking
- Goroutine-based message handling
- Safe connection state management
- Non-blocking ticker update channel

## Technology Stack
- Language: Go
- WebSocket Library: gorilla/websocket
- Testing: testify
- Rate Limiting: Custom token bucket implementation

## Development Approach
