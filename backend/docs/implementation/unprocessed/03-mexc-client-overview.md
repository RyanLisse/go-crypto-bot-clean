# MEXC Exchange Client Implementation: Overview

This document provides an overview of the MEXC API client implementation in Go, covering both REST API and WebSocket integration for the crypto trading bot.

## 1. Overview of MEXC API Integration

The MEXC client will be implemented in the `internal/platform/mexc` package and will provide:

1. REST API client for:
   - Account information & wallet balances
   - Order placement, cancellation, and queries
   - Market data (tickers, order books, etc.)
   - Coin listing information

2. WebSocket client for real-time:
   - Price updates (tickers)
   - Order execution updates
   - Account balance changes

## 2. API Client Structure

```

## 3. Core Client Design Principles

1. **Interface Implementation**
   - The MEXC client implements the `ExchangeService` interface from the domain layer
   - This enables dependency injection and seamless testing with mocks

2. **Error Handling**
   - All API errors are properly wrapped with context
   - Error types are defined for different error cases
   - Typed errors allow for better error handling in the application layer

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Respects the MEXC API rate limits
   - Implements exponential backoff for retries
   - Token bucket algorithm for distributing requests

4. **Caching**
   - Market data is cached with appropriate TTL
   - Avoids unnecessary API calls for frequently accessed data
   - Thread-safe cache implementation

5. **Concurrency**
   - Thread-safe operations using sync.Mutex/RWMutex
   - WebSocket operations using goroutines
   - Context-based cancellation for all API operations

6. **Graceful Reconnection**
   - WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Automatic resubscription after reconnection
   - Heartbeat mechanism to detect connection issues

7. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Connection pooling for REST API calls
   - Efficient JSON parsing directly into structs
   - Minimal memory allocations for high-frequency operations
