# Processed Implementation Files

This directory contains a record of implementation files that have been successfully implemented and verified against their specifications.

## Process for Marking Files as Processed

1. Verify that the implementation meets all requirements specified in the documentation
2. Ensure all tests related to the implementation are passing
3. Create a copy of the specification file in this directory
4. Update the processed_files.md document with the implementation details
5. Add a note in the memory bank about the completed implementation

## Tracking Document

See [processed_files.md](./processed_files.md) for a complete list of processed implementation files and their verification status.
