# Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the optimization and refactoring plan for the go-crypto-bot project. The plan is divided into three phases:

1. âœ… HTTP Layer Unification (Completed)
2. Core Adapters Refactoring
3. Polish & Finalize

## Phase 1: HTTP Layer Unification (âœ… Completed)

The HTTP layer has been successfully unified using the Chi router. All handlers and tests have been updated to use Chi, and the Gin dependency has been removed.

### Key Achievements:
- Standardized all HTTP handlers to use Chi router
- Updated all tests to use Chi router
- Removed Gin dependency
- Maintained API contracts during transition
- Improved code consistency and maintainability

## Phase 2: Core Adapters Refactoring (ðŸ”„ In Progress)

### Step 1: Cache Refactoring
- [ ] Complete StandardCache implementation
  - Implement remaining methods (GetAllTickers, GetLatestTickers)
  - Add proper error handling and logging
  - Ensure thread safety
- [ ] Update factory to use StandardCache
- [ ] Test concurrent access patterns

### Step 2: Repository Consolidation
- [ ] Move repository files to standard location
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions
- [ ] Update import paths
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests

### Step 3: Gateway Refactoring
- [ ] Implement real Gemini API client
- [ ] Complete MEXC client implementation
- [ ] Replace mock providers with real implementations
- [ ] Add proper error handling and retries

## Phase 3: Polish & Finalize

### Error Handling
- [ ] Standardize error types and messages
- [ ] Implement proper error wrapping
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Improve error logging

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document error codes and handling
- [ ] Update README with latest changes

### Testing
- [ ] Increase test coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add performance tests
- [ ] Document testing strategy

### Code Quality
- [ ] Run linters and fix issues
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Remove unused code
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Go best practices
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add proper comments and documentation

### Testing
- Write tests before implementing features
- Maintain high test coverage
- Include edge cases in tests
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

### Error Handling
- Use proper error types
- Add context to errors
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle all error cases

### Performance
- Profile before optimizing
- Use benchmarks to verify improvements
- Consider concurrent access patterns
- Cache appropriately
