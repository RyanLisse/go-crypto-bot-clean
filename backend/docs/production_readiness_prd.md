# Production Readiness PRD

<context>
# Overview  
This document outlines the requirements and plan for making the Crypto Bot backend production-ready. The backend serves as the foundation for a cryptocurrency trading bot that integrates with the MEXC exchange, providing users with account management, market data, and trading capabilities.

The current implementation has several issues that need to be addressed before it can be considered production-ready, including API endpoint issues, database problems, and authentication concerns.

# Core Features  
1. **Account Management**
   - What it does: Allows users to view their wallet balances, transaction history, and manage their accounts
   - Why it's important: Provides users with visibility into their cryptocurrency holdings
   - How it works: Integrates with MEXC API to fetch real account data and stores it locally

2. **Market Data**
   - What it does: Provides real-time and historical market data for cryptocurrencies
   - Why it's important: Enables users to make informed trading decisions
   - How it works: Fetches data from MEXC API, caches it locally, and exposes it through REST endpoints

3. **Trading Functionality**
   - What it does: Allows users to execute trades, set up automated trading rules, and monitor positions
   - Why it's important: Core functionality of the trading bot
   - How it works: Executes trades through MEXC API based on user input or automated rules

4. **Authentication and Security**
   - What it does: Secures user data and ensures only authorized access to the API
   - Why it's important: Protects sensitive financial information and trading capabilities
   - How it works: Integrates with Clerk for authentication and implements proper authorization checks

# User Experience  
**User Personas:**
- Cryptocurrency traders looking for automated trading solutions
- Investors wanting to monitor their cryptocurrency portfolios
- Developers integrating with the trading bot API

**Key User Flows:**
- User authentication and account setup
- Viewing account balances and transaction history
- Setting up and monitoring automated trading rules
- Executing manual trades
