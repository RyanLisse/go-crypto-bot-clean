# Active Context – Main Initialization Modularization

## Current Focus

**Authentication is now handled exclusively by Clerk middleware using the official Clerk Go SDK.** All JWT and test authentication code, helpers, and references have been removed from both implementation and tests. Context keys for user ID and role are defined in `context_keys.go` under the `middleware` package. All tests and test helpers referencing JWT or test auth have been removed or refactored to Clerk-only. Integration test isolation and error handling have been improved, and all tests now pass for Clerk-only authentication.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Clerk-only authentication enforced via official Clerk Go SDK
- ✅ Removed all JWT/test auth code, helpers, and references
- ✅ Updated all tests and helpers to Clerk-only
- ✅ Refactored integration tests for full isolation and reliability
- ✅ Fixed all related lints, import issues, and unreachable code in tests
- ✅ All tests now pass for Clerk-only authentication

## In Progress

- Review and update documentation to reflect Clerk-only authentication and removed JWT/test auth
- Ensure all error messages and logs are free from sensitive data leakage
- Add/expand Clerk auth edge case tests (invalid/missing tokens, forbidden access, etc.)
- Further clean up any remaining linter warnings in tests for full code health

## Next Steps

1. Update project documentation to describe Clerk-only authentication and test structure
2. Add/expand edge case tests for Clerk middleware (see recommended template)
3. Continue to enforce separation of concerns and robust error handling
4. Monitor for regressions or issues with authentication and startup logic
5. Upgrade to `github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2` if not already done

## Technical Decisions

- All authentication logic is now Clerk-only and testable
- Tests for helpers and middleware ensure reliability of authentication and startup code
- Integration tests use isolated mocks to prevent state leakage

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Ensuring no legacy JWT/test auth code remains
  - **Solution:** Comprehensive search and removal of all JWT/test auth code, helpers, and references

- **Challenge:** Ensuring test isolation for integration tests
  - **Solution:** Create all mocks and usecases in each subtest to prevent state leakage

- **Challenge:** Ensuring startup failures and auth errors are logged and fatal (without leaking sensitive data)
  - **Solution:** Helpers use structured logger and fatal on error, logs reviewed for sensitive data

**This context supersedes previous authentication/JWT modularization notes.**
  - **Solution**: Clerk-only middleware now provides a unified interface for all authentication in the backend

## Dependencies

- Clerk API for authentication (`github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go`)
- Context package for storing user information

## Testing Approach

- Unit and integration tests for Clerk authentication middleware
- Edge case tests for invalid/missing tokens, forbidden access, etc.
- Manual testing with Clerk dashboard and production-like flows
