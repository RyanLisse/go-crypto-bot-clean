# Project Progress - Go Crypto Bot Optimization

## Overall Status
We are currently in Phase 2 of the optimization process. Phase 1 has been completed successfully, and several key components of Phase 2 have been implemented. We're making steady progress with approximately 65% of planned optimizations now complete.

## Milestones Achieved

### Phase 1: Measurement, Cleanup & Low-Hanging Fruit
- âœ… HTTP Layer Unification
  - Removed Gin router completely
  - Switched to Chi router for all handlers
  - Updated all tests to use Chi router
  - Removed Gin dependency from go.mod
  - Verified all routes work correctly with new implementation

### Phase 2: Performance & Resource Optimization
- âœ… Repository Model Updates
  - Added timestamps to all relevant models
  - Aligned domain models with database entities
  - Standardized field mapping between domains and repositories
  - Completed full repository consolidation
  - Created consistent naming conventions

- âœ… Cache Refactoring
  - Implemented StandardCache with all required methods
  - Added proper TTL support and thread safety
  - Verified interface compliance with MarketCache
  - Completed GetAllTickers and GetLatestTickers implementation
  - Added comprehensive test coverage

- âœ… Gateway Refactoring
  - Completed MEXC client implementation
  - Added error handling and retries
  - Implemented rate limiting
  - Added proper logging
  - Completed integration tests

- ðŸ”„ Error Handling Standardization (80% complete)
  - Defined error types and handling patterns
  - Implemented error wrapping
  - Updated handler error responses
  - Documentation in progress

- ðŸ”„ Logging Improvements (60% complete)
  - Implemented structured logging
  - Added log correlation IDs
  - Working on performance metrics logging

## In Progress
The following tasks are currently being worked on:

1. **Endpoint Verification Post-Migration**
   - Created comprehensive endpoint testing plan
   - Implemented automated test script
   - Testing all API endpoints for correct functioning
   - Validating error handling
   - Measuring performance metrics

2. **Completing Error Handling Implementation**
   - Finalizing custom error types
   - Ensuring consistent error mapping across all handlers
   - Completing error documentation

3. **Finishing Logging Enhancements**
   - Implementing structured logging consistently
   - Adding performance metrics
   - Setting up log aggregation

## Upcoming Work

### Next Items (2-4 weeks)
1. Concurrency Optimization
   - Worker goroutine review
   - Mutex contention analysis
   - Connection pooling verification

2. Memory Optimization
   - Allocation profiling
   - Slice and string handling improvements
   - Object pooling where appropriate

### Future Items (1-3 months)
1. Phase 3: Polish & Finalize
   - Code quality improvements
   - Test coverage expansion
   - Documentation updates
   - Performance tuning

## Known Issues and Blockers
- No major blockers currently
- Need to validate thread safety in the cache implementation under high load
- Some repository methods still need optimization for complex queries

## Performance Metrics
Initial measurements:
- Average API response time: ~120ms
- P95 response time: ~350ms
- Memory usage: ~200MB under normal load

Target metrics:
- Average API response time: <100ms
- P95 response time: <250ms
- Memory usage: <180MB under normal load

## Next Meeting
Schedule performance review meeting after completion of endpoint verification and error handling improvements.
