# Product Requirements Document: Railway Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation strategy for deploying the Go Crypto Bot backend to Railway, a modern cloud platform for deploying applications. Due to initial deployment challenges, we've adopted an incremental approach that gradually adds components to identify and resolve issues.

## Goals
- Deploy the Go Crypto Bot backend to Railway using an incremental approach
- Ensure the application is accessible via a public URL
- Set up proper health checks for monitoring
- Implement a deployment process that can be automated
- Document the deployment process for future reference

## Non-Goals
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline (will be addressed in a separate task)
- Implementing advanced monitoring and alerting
- Setting up custom domains (will be addressed in a separate task)

## Current Status
The application is currently deployed at https://piquant-desire-production.up.railway.app with the following components:
- Minimal API with health check endpoint
- Configuration management system
- Basic routing structure

## Requirements

### 1. Incremental Deployment Approach
- **1.1** ✅ Start with a minimal API that passes health checks
- **1.2** ✅ Add configuration management
- **1.3** ⏳ Add database connection
- **1.4** ⏳ Add core business logic
- **1.5** ⏳ Add external service integrations
- **1.6** ⏳ Complete the application
- **1.7** ⏳ Document the process and findings for future reference

This incremental approach allows us to identify and fix issues at each step, ensuring a stable deployment.

### 2. Deployment Configuration
- **2.1** ✅ Create a `railway.toml` file with appropriate configuration
- **2.2** ✅ Configure health check endpoints and timeouts
- **2.3** ✅ Set up environment variables for the application
- **2.4** ✅ Configure restart policies for the application

### 3. Docker Configuration
- **3.1** ✅ Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for the application
- **3.2** ✅ Optimize the Docker image for size and security
- **3.3** ✅ Ensure the Docker image includes all necessary dependencies
- **3.4** ✅ Configure the Docker image to run with appropriate permissions

### 4. Application Health Checks
- **4.1** ✅ Implement a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK response
- **4.2** ✅ Ensure the health check endpoint is lightweight and doesn't impact performance
- **4.3** ⏳ Configure the health check to verify critical dependencies (database, etc.)
- **4.4** ⏳ Implement appropriate logging for health check failures

### 5. Database Configuration
- **5.1** ⏳ Configure the application to use SQLite for data storage
- **5.2** ⏳ Ensure the database file is stored in a persistent location
- **5.3** ⏳ Implement database migrations on startup
- **5.4** ⏳ Configure appropriate backup mechanisms for the database

### 6. Logging and Monitoring
- **6.1** ✅ Configure the application to output logs in a structured format
- **6.2** ✅ Ensure logs are accessible through the Railway dashboard
- **6.3** ✅ Implement appropriate log levels for different environments
- **6.4** ⏳ Configure log rotation to prevent excessive log storage

### 7. Security
- **7.1** ✅ Ensure sensitive environment variables are properly secured
- **7.2** ✅ Configure the application to run with minimal privileges
- **7.3** ⏳ Implement appropriate CORS policies for the API
- **7.4** ⏳ Ensure the application follows security best practices

### 8. Documentation
- **8.1** ⏳ Document the deployment process in the project README
- **8.2** ⏳ Create a troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
- **8.3** ⏳ Document the environment variables used by the application
- **8.4** ⏳ Create a guide for local development and testing

## Success Criteria
- ✅ The application is successfully deployed to Railway
- ✅ The application is accessible via a public URL
- ✅ Health checks are passing consistently
- ✅ The application can be redeployed without manual intervention
- ⏳ The deployment process is documented and repeatable
- ⏳ All components of the application are working correctly

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Minimal Deployment (Completed)
- Created a minimal API with health check endpoint
- Configured Railway deployment with appropriate settings
- Verified deployment and health checks

### Phase 2: Configuration Management (Completed)
- Added configuration system with environment variable support
- Updated Dockerfile to include configuration files
- Deployed and verified configuration is working

### Phase 3: Database Integration (Next)
- Add SQLite database connection
- Configure persistent storage
- Implement basic data access

### Phase 4: Core Business Logic
- Add domain models and services
- Implement API endpoints for core functionality
- Test and verify business logic

### Phase 5: External Integrations
- Add external API integrations
- Configure authentication and security
- Test end-to-end functionality

## Timeline
- Initial minimal deployment: 1 day (Completed)
- Configuration management: 1 day (Completed)
- Database integration: 1 day (In Progress)
- Core business logic: 2 days
- External integrations: 1 day
- Documentation: 1 day
- Total: 7 days

## Future Considerations
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Implementing advanced monitoring and alerting
- Setting up custom domains for the application
- Scaling the application to handle increased load
- Implementing a more robust database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL)
