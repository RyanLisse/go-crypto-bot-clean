# Product Requirements Document: Railway Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for deploying the Go Crypto Bot backend to Railway, a modern cloud platform for deploying applications. The deployment should be reliable, maintainable, and follow best practices for cloud deployments.

## Goals
- Deploy the Go Crypto Bot backend to Railway using an incremental approach
- Ensure the application is accessible via a public URL
- Set up proper health checks for monitoring
- Implement a deployment process that can be automated
- Document the deployment process for future reference

## Non-Goals
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline (will be addressed in a separate task)
- Implementing advanced monitoring and alerting
- Setting up custom domains (will be addressed in a separate task)

## Requirements

### 1. Incremental Deployment Approach
- **1.1** Start with a minimal API that passes health checks
- **1.2** Gradually add components from the existing codebase
- **1.3** Test after each addition to identify and fix issues
- **1.4** Document the process and findings for future reference

### 2. Deployment Configuration
- **2.1** Create a `railway.toml` file with appropriate configuration
- **2.2** Configure health check endpoints and timeouts
- **2.3** Set up environment variables for the application
- **2.4** Configure restart policies for the application

### 3. Docker Configuration
- **3.1** Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for the application
- **3.2** Optimize the Docker image for size and security
- **3.3** Ensure the Docker image includes all necessary dependencies
- **3.4** Configure the Docker image to run with appropriate permissions

### 4. Application Health Checks
- **4.1** Implement a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK response
- **4.2** Ensure the health check endpoint is lightweight and doesn't impact performance
- **4.3** Configure the health check to verify critical dependencies (database, etc.)
- **4.4** Implement appropriate logging for health check failures

### 5. Database Configuration
- **5.1** Configure the application to use SQLite for data storage
- **5.2** Ensure the database file is stored in a persistent location
- **5.3** Implement database migrations on startup
- **5.4** Configure appropriate backup mechanisms for the database

### 6. Logging and Monitoring
- **6.1** Configure the application to output logs in a structured format
- **6.2** Ensure logs are accessible through the Railway dashboard
- **6.3** Implement appropriate log levels for different environments
- **6.4** Configure log rotation to prevent excessive log storage

### 7. Security
- **7.1** Ensure sensitive environment variables are properly secured
- **7.2** Configure the application to run with minimal privileges
- **7.3** Implement appropriate CORS policies for the API
- **7.4** Ensure the application follows security best practices

### 8. Documentation
- **8.1** Document the deployment process in the project README
- **8.2** Create a troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
- **8.3** Document the environment variables used by the application
- **8.4** Create a guide for local development and testing

## Success Criteria
- The application is successfully deployed to Railway
- The application is accessible via a public URL
- Health checks are passing consistently
- The application can be redeployed without manual intervention
- The deployment process is documented and repeatable
- All components of the application are working correctly

## Timeline
- Initial minimal deployment: 1 day
- Incremental component addition: 3 days
- Testing and validation: 1 day
- Documentation: 1 day
- Total: 6 days

## Future Considerations
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Implementing advanced monitoring and alerting
- Setting up custom domains for the application
- Scaling the application to handle increased load
- Implementing a more robust database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL)
