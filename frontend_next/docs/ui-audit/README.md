# UI Consistency Audit Framework

This directory contains the documentation and resources for conducting a systematic UI audit between the original Vite implementation and the new Next.js version.

## Directory Structure

- `/component-inventory`: Detailed documentation of all UI components in both implementations
- `/screenshots`: Visual comparison screenshots of key UI elements and pages
- `/comparison-results`: Findings, discrepancies, and recommendations

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Component Inventory

For each component, we document:

- Component name and purpose
- Location in codebase (both implementations)
- Props/interface
- Visual appearance
- Behaviors and interactions
- Dependencies and related components

### 2. Comparison Criteria

Components are compared based on:

- **Visual consistency**: Colors, typography, spacing, layout, responsive behavior
- **Functional parity**: Behaviors, interactions, state management
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance**: Render time, bundle size impact
- **Code quality**: Structure, maintainability, reusability

### 3. Audit Process

1. Catalog all components from Vite implementation
2. Match with corresponding Next.js components
3. Document differences using comparison sheets
4. Take side-by-side screenshots of components in various states
5. Test interactions and behaviors
6. Document findings and recommendations

### 4. Tracking System

Each component will be assigned one of the following statuses:

- ‚úÖ **Consistent**: Visually and functionally equivalent
- üü° **Minor issues**: Small visual or behavioral differences
- üî¥ **Major issues**: Significant visual or behavioral differences
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not implemented**: Component exists in Vite but not in Next.js
- üÜï **New component**: Component exists in Next.js but not in Vite

## Implementation Plan

1. Create component inventory sheets for all major UI elements
2. Implement systematic visual review of all pages
3. Document discrepancies
4. Prioritize fixes based on user impact and visibility
5. Implement fixes in the Next.js codebase
6. Re-verify consistency after fixes

## Getting Started

To contribute to the UI audit:

1. Select a component or page to audit
2. Fill out the component inventory template in `/component-inventory`
3. Take screenshots of both implementations and save to `/screenshots`
4. Document findings in the comparison sheet in `/comparison-results`
