# UI Component Inventory

This directory contains a comprehensive inventory of UI components from both the original Vite implementation and the new Next.js implementation, allowing for structured comparison and consistency analysis.

## Purpose

The purpose of this inventory is to:
1. Document all UI components across both implementations
2. Establish visual and functional consistency between implementations
3. Identify and address inconsistencies or issues
4. Ensure accessibility standards are maintained
5. Track component migration progress

## Structure

- `README.md` - This overview file
- `template.md` - Template for component documentation
- `index.md` - Complete list of all components with status
- Individual component files named according to their function (e.g., `button.md`, `card.md`)
- `/screenshots/` - Visual references for each component
  - `/vite/` - Screenshots from original Vite implementation
  - `/nextjs/` - Screenshots from new Next.js implementation

## Component Documentation Guide

Each component should be documented following the template provided in `template.md`. Documentation should include:

- Basic component information (name, type, purpose)
- Implementation details for both Vite and Next.js
- Visual and functional comparison
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance considerations
- Consistency rating
- Issues and recommendations

## Adding a New Component to Inventory

1. Copy `template.md` to a new file named after the component
2. Fill in all required sections
3. Take screenshots of both implementations and add to respective directories
4. Add component to `index.md` with current status

## Consistency Ratings

- **Complete (5/5)**: Component visually and functionally identical across implementations
- **High (4/5)**: Minor visual differences but functionally equivalent
- **Medium (3/5)**: Noticeable visual differences but core functionality preserved
- **Low (2/5)**: Significant visual and minor functional differences
- **Inconsistent (1/5)**: Major functional and visual differences
- **Not Migrated (0/5)**: Component exists in Vite but not yet in Next.js

## Progress Tracking

The overall migration progress and component status is tracked in `index.md`.
