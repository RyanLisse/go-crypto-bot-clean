# UI Consistency Test Plan

This document outlines the approach for testing and verifying UI consistency between the Vite and Next.js implementations.

## Testing Methodologies

### 1. Visual Regression Testing

- **Objective**: Identify visual differences between components in both implementations
- **Tools**: Playwright for automated screenshots
- **Process**:
  1. Create baseline screenshots of all components in Vite implementation
  2. Take corresponding screenshots in Next.js implementation
  3. Use image comparison to identify differences
  4. Document differences in component inventory files

### 2. Functional Testing

- **Objective**: Verify functionality and behavior parity
- **Tools**: Manual testing, Jest/React Testing Library
- **Process**:
  1. Define expected behaviors for each component
  2. Test all interaction states (hover, click, focus, etc.)
  3. Verify state changes and event handlers
  4. Document any behavioral differences

### 3. Responsive Testing

- **Viewport Sizes**:
  - Mobile: 375px, 390px, 414px
  - Tablet: 768px, 820px, 1024px
  - Desktop: 1280px, 1440px, 1920px
- **Process**:
  1. Test each component at all viewport sizes
  2. Document any layout or responsive behavior differences
  3. Pay special attention to breakpoint behavior

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing

- **Browsers**:
  - Chrome (latest)
  - Firefox (latest)
  - Safari (latest)
  - Edge (latest)
- **Process**:
  1. Verify visual and functional consistency across browsers
  2. Document any browser-specific issues

### 5. Accessibility Testing

- **Tools**: axe-core, keyboard navigation tests
- **Process**:
  1. Run automated accessibility tests on both implementations
  2. Perform manual keyboard navigation testing
  3. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA)
  4. Document any accessibility differences

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Component Inventory & Initial Assessment
- Create complete component inventory
- Identify high-priority components based on usage
- Establish baseline screenshots
- Duration: 1 week

### Phase 2: Visual & Functional Testing
- Conduct visual testing for all components
- Perform functional testing for all components
- Document all findings
- Duration: 2 weeks

### Phase 3: Special Test Cases
- Test responsive behavior
- Perform cross-browser testing
- Conduct accessibility testing
- Duration: 1 week

### Phase 4: Regression Testing
- Retest all fixed components
- Verify alignment with requirements
- Final sign-off
- Duration: 1 week

## Documentation Standards

All test results should be documented following these standards:

1. **Clear Pass/Fail Status**: Use the status indicators defined in the README
2. **Visual Evidence**: Include screenshots demonstrating any issues
3. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide clear descriptions of any inconsistencies
4. **Reproducible Steps**: For functional issues, include steps to reproduce
5. **Severity Assessment**: Categorize issues as minor or major based on impact

## Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked in the central component-tracker.md file, with regular updates to:
- Number of components audited
- Number and percentage of components with issues
- Number of resolved issues

## Testing Schedule

| Week | Focus | Components |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1    | Core Components | Button, Input, Card, etc. |
| 2    | Layout Components | Header, Sidebar, etc. |
| 3    | Form & Data Components | Form, Select, Charts, etc. |
| 4    | Pages & Navigation | Dashboard, Portfolio, Menu, etc. |
