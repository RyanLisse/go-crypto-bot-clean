### Current Task: Task 6 - Trade Execution System Implementation (in progress)

We are working on implementing the Trade Execution System, which is a crucial component for executing trades on cryptocurrency exchanges. We've made significant progress on this task:

1. ✅ Created domain models for Orders, including OrderSide, OrderType, and TimeInForce enums.
2. ✅ Implemented the TradeService for MEXC integration with all necessary methods.
3. ✅ Created the TradeUseCase with methods for placing, canceling, and querying orders.
4. ✅ Implemented OrderRepository with GORM for persisting order data.
5. ✅ Developed TradeFactory to manage trade-related components.
6. ✅ Implemented TradeHandler with HTTP endpoints for trade operations.
7. ✅ Implemented AutoBuyHandler for auto-buy rule management.
8. ✅ Integrated the Trade components with the main application.

Next steps:
1. Implement WebSocket integration for real-time order updates.
2. Develop a testing strategy for the trade execution system.
3. Add transaction support for order operations.
4. Create monitoring and telemetry for trade operations.

### Implementation Details and Decisions

- The TradeService has been implemented to handle the specifics of the MEXC API integration for trading operations.
- The OrderRepository uses GORM for database persistence, with proper entity mapping and CRUD operations.
- The TradeFactory creates and wires together all trade-related components, following the dependency injection pattern.
- Error handling and logging have been implemented throughout the system using zerolog.
- The TradeHandler provides RESTful endpoints for trade operations, with appropriate error responses.
- The AutoBuyHandler provides endpoints for managing auto-buy rules, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete rules.

### Technical Constraints and Considerations

- We're using the MEXC API for trade execution, which requires careful handling of API limits and error responses.
- Order persistence must be resilient to ensure we don't lose track of orders during network issues.
- We need to ensure proper validation of order parameters before submitting them to the exchange.
- Authentication and authorization are critical for trade operations to ensure security.

### Blockers/Dependencies

- Testing against the real MEXC API requires API keys and test environment setup.
- Need to integrate the WebSocket API for real-time order updates.

### Notes

- The implementation follows our established architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns between domains, use cases, and adapters.
- We've ensured proper logging throughout the trade execution path for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## General Project Context
- The backend implementation now includes:
  - Complete MEXC API integration for market data and trading
  - Position management system with database persistence
  - Trade execution system with order management and persistence
  - HTTP API endpoints for all main functionality
  - Factory pattern implementation for proper dependency injection

## Implementation Notes
- The Position Management System includes:
  - A comprehensive domain model with Position, PositionSide, and PositionStatus types
  - Repository implementations for all persistence operations
  - Use cases for creating, reading, updating, and closing positions
  - Service layer for business logic including position performance tracking
  - HTTP handlers implementing RESTful API endpoints for all position operations
  
- The Trade Execution System includes:
  - Order domain model with OrderSide, OrderType, OrderStatus, and TimeInForce enums
  - GORM-based OrderRepository for persistence with full CRUD operations
  - TradeUseCase implementation for business logic
  - TradeService for integration with MEXC exchange API
  - HTTP handlers for RESTful API endpoints supporting order operations
  - TradeFactory for properly managing dependencies and component creation

- The HTTP API endpoints for positions follow RESTful principles with these key routes:
  - POST /positions: Create a new position
  - GET /positions: List positions with filtering options
  - GET /positions/open: Get open positions
  - GET /positions/:id: Get a specific position
  - PUT /positions/:id: Update a position
  - PUT /positions/:id/close: Close a position
  - DELETE /positions/:id: Delete a position

- The HTTP API endpoints for trading include:
  - POST /trades/orders: Place a new order
  - DELETE /trades/orders/:symbol/:orderId: Cancel an order
  - GET /trades/orders/:symbol/:orderId: Get order status
  - GET /trades/orders/open/:symbol: Get open orders
  - GET /trades/orders/history/:symbol: Get order history
  - GET /trades/calculate/:symbol: Calculate required quantity

- All implementations include comprehensive unit tests
