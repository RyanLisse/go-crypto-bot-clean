# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus has shifted from implementing the Position Management System (Task 5) to the Trade Execution System (Task 6).

### Completed
- Task 5: Position Management System
  - ✅ Task 5.1: Define position model and repository interface
  - ✅ Task 5.2: Implement position use cases and service layer
  - ✅ Task 5.3: Create HTTP API handlers and position visualization

### In Progress
- Task 6: Implement Trade Execution System
  - Task 6.1: Define trade execution models and interfaces
  - Task 6.2: Implement trade execution service
  - Task 6.3: Create HTTP API handlers for trade execution

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of the Trade Execution System
2. Define the necessary models and interfaces for trade execution
3. Focus on implementing the MEXC API integration for trade execution

## General Project Context
- The backend implementation now includes:
  - Complete MEXC API integration (Task ID 2)
  - Database layer implementation with GORM (Task ID 3)
  - Market data services and use cases (Task ID 4)
  - Position management system with API endpoints (Task ID 5, fully completed)
- The hexagonal architecture has been consistently implemented across all components:
  - Domain layer contains the core business models and services
  - Adapter layer contains implementations of ports (API clients, repositories, and HTTP handlers)
  - The service layer orchestrates the interaction between ports
- The next phase will focus on trade execution functionality, which will integrate with the position management system

## Implementation Notes
- The Position Management System includes:
  - A comprehensive domain model with Position, PositionSide, and PositionStatus types
  - Repository implementations for all persistence operations
  - Use cases for creating, reading, updating, and closing positions
  - Service layer for business logic including position performance tracking
  - HTTP handlers implementing RESTful API endpoints for all position operations
- The HTTP API endpoints for positions follow RESTful principles with these key routes:
  - POST /positions: Create a new position
  - GET /positions: List positions with filtering options
  - GET /positions/open: Get open positions
  - GET /positions/:id: Get a specific position
  - PUT /positions/:id: Update a position
  - PUT /positions/:id/close: Close a position
  - DELETE /positions/:id: Delete a position
- All implementations include comprehensive unit tests
