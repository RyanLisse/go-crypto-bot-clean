## Current Task
- Task ID: 2.7
- Description: Implementing the MexcAPI interface focusing on order-related functionality and websocket client
- Completion Status: âœ… Completed. Successfully implemented and fixed PlaceOrder, GetOrderStatus, and CancelOrder methods. Updated the OrderResponse struct to handle both string and numeric order IDs. All implementations now build successfully and pass tests.

## Next Steps
- Task ID: 2.8 - Implement secure API key management and error handling
- Implement enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms for API requests
- Add comprehensive tests for the API client implementations
- Document the API client usage and rate limiting approach
- Update task-master status for completed tasks

## General Project Context
[Updated: Completed Task 2.7 - Successfully implemented the MexcAPI interface with REST client and rate limiting. The REST client now properly handles all required methods from the MexcAPI interface, including GetAccount, GetMarketData, GetKlines, GetOrderBook, PlaceOrder, CancelOrder, and GetOrderStatus. Each method correctly implements the interface contract and handles various response formats from the MEXC API. Rate limiting is properly implemented using TokenBucket to respect the exchange's API request limits. All tests are now passing and the backend builds successfully with no errors. Next steps include implementing secure API key management and more robust error handling as part of Task 2.8.]
