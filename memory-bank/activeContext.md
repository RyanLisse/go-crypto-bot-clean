# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing the Railway deployment for the backend (Task 1), which involves deploying the Go backend to Railway using an incremental approach. We've completed Phase 1 (basic API, health check, configuration management) and are now working on Phase 2 (database integration). We have fixed critical issues with the MEXC client implementation, specifically with symbol format handling, and implemented GORM repositories for Position and Transaction models.

### Tasks

- Phase 1: Minimal Viable Deployment (Completed): Basic API, health check, configuration, logging, Docker, Railway setup
- Phase 2: Database Integration (Completed): SQLite setup, GORM integration, data models, Turso integration, and database synchronization
- Phase 3: Authentication and Security (Partially Completed): Clerk SDK integration, JWT validation implemented; authorization pending
- Phase 4: External Services Integration (Pending): Gemini AI, OpenAI, Telegram, Slack
- Phase 5: Monitoring and Optimization (Pending): Detailed logging, performance monitoring, backups
