# Active Context

## Current Task
**Description:** We have successfully completed Task ID 5: "Implement Position Management System". All subtasks have been completed, including the Position HTTP Handlers (Task 5.3) which provide a complete RESTful API for position management operations.

**Completion Status:** All subtasks of Task 5 (5.1, 5.2, and 5.3) are now complete. The entire position management system is fully implemented and tested, with proper HTTP API endpoints for all position-related operations.

## Next Steps
1. Begin working on Task ID 6: "Implement Trade Execution System"
   - Set up the trade execution domain models
   - Design and implement the trade execution service
   - Create repositories and use cases for trade management
   - Develop HTTP API endpoints for trade execution
2. Coordinate the integration between the Position Management System and the Trade Execution System
3. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for the new implementation

## General Project Context
- The backend implementation now includes:
  - Complete MEXC API integration (Task ID 2)
  - Database layer implementation with GORM (Task ID 3)
  - Market data services and use cases (Task ID 4)
  - Position management system with API endpoints (Task ID 5, fully completed)
- The hexagonal architecture has been consistently implemented across all components:
  - Domain layer contains the core business models and services
  - Adapter layer contains implementations of ports (API clients, repositories, and HTTP handlers)
  - The service layer orchestrates the interaction between ports
- The next phase will focus on trade execution functionality, which will integrate with the position management system

## Implementation Notes
- The Position Management System includes:
  - A comprehensive domain model with Position, PositionSide, and PositionStatus types
  - Repository implementations for all persistence operations
  - Use cases for creating, reading, updating, and closing positions
  - Service layer for business logic including position performance tracking
  - HTTP handlers implementing RESTful API endpoints for all position operations
- The HTTP API endpoints for positions follow RESTful principles with these key routes:
  - POST /positions: Create a new position
  - GET /positions: List positions with filtering options
  - GET /positions/open: Get open positions
  - GET /positions/:id: Get a specific position
  - PUT /positions/:id: Update a position
  - PUT /positions/:id/close: Close a position
  - DELETE /positions/:id: Delete a position
- All implementations include comprehensive unit tests
