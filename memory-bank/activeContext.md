# Active Context

## Current Project Status (June 2024)

Major architectural refactoring has been completed, with the codebase now aligned with Clean Architecture principles. All core components have been standardized, including repository patterns, error handling, factories, middleware, and migration strategies. The codebase now has consistent patterns and reduced redundancy, as documented in `docs/refactoring-summary.md`.

## Active Development Focus

### Current Task: Task 7 - Risk Management System Implementation (in progress)

We are currently focused on implementing the Risk Management System, which is a critical component for ensuring trading safety and compliance with user risk profiles. We've made progress on this task:

1. âœ… Subtask 7.1: Implemented Risk Control Models and Core Domain Logic
   - Created comprehensive risk controls:
     - ConcentrationControl: Prevents over-concentration in a single asset
     - LiquidityControl: Ensures trading in markets with sufficient volume
     - ExposureControl: Limits total market exposure based on risk profile
     - DrawdownControl: Monitors and limits portfolio drawdown
     - VolatilityControl: Evaluates market volatility before trading
     - PositionSizeControl: Enforces proper position sizing based on portfolio
   - Implemented RiskEvaluator to coordinate multiple risk controls
   - Developed BaseRiskControl providing common functionality
   - Created relevant domain models and interfaces

Next steps:
1. **Current Focus - Subtask 7.2: Develop Risk Management Repository and Persistence Layer**
2. Design database schema for storing risk assessments, profiles, and constraints
3. Implement repositories for risk-related entities
4. Integrate risk management with the trading and position management systems

### Implementation Details and Decisions

- Risk controls follow a consistent interface (RiskControl) allowing easy composition and evaluation
- The system supports different risk profiles (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive) with appropriate thresholds
- Risk evaluations produce detailed assessments with recommendations for the user
- Domain events are used to notify other system components about risk violations
- The risk system is designed to be extensible, allowing new risk controls to be easily added

### Technical Constraints and Considerations

- Risk evaluations must be performed efficiently to not slow down trading operations
- The system needs to handle real-time market data for accurate risk assessment
- Risk profiles and constraints must be persisted and easily configurable
- Integration with position and trade systems must maintain transactional integrity

### Blockers/Dependencies

- Need to design database schema for risk-related entities
- Integration with user configuration system for risk profiles

## Current Focus: Risk Management Repository Implementation (Task 7.2)

### Implementation Plan

1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Create entity definitions for risk profiles, constraints, assessments, and metrics
   - Define relationships between entities
   - Plan indices for optimal query performance
   - Document schema in comments and migration files

2. **Repository Interface Definition**
   - Define interfaces in `internal/domain/port` following standardized pattern
   - Include CRUD operations and specialized query methods
   - Ensure context is used for cancellation and tracing
   - Document expected behavior and error conditions

3. **GORM Entity Implementation**
   - Create entity structs in `internal/adapter/persistence/gorm/entity`
   - Add proper GORM tags and hooks
   - Implement ToModel/FromModel conversion methods
   - Add validation annotations

4. **Repository Implementation**
   - Create repository implementations in `internal/adapter/persistence/gorm`
   - Use the standardized base repository pattern
   - Implement all interface methods with proper error handling
   - Add transaction support for multi-entity operations

5. **Migration Setup**
   - Create migration entries in the AutoMigrate system
   - Add proper entity dependencies
   - Document migration order and constraints

6. **Testing**
   - Create integration tests for repository implementations
   - Implement mock repositories for service testing
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

## Next Steps After Repository Implementation

Once the Risk Management Repository is complete, we will:

1. Implement the Risk Use Case and Trade Validation Integration (Task 7.3)
2. Create Risk Management API Endpoints (Task 7.4)
3. Implement Risk Notification System (Task 7.5)

## Dependencies and Requirements

- Follow the standardized repository pattern documented in `systemPatterns.md`
- Ensure all repositories implement proper error handling using AppError
- Use the factory pattern for dependency injection
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Document all repository methods with Go doc comments

## General Project Context
- The backend implementation now includes:
  - Complete MEXC API integration for market data and trading
  - Position management system with database persistence
  - Trade execution system with order management and persistence
  - HTTP API endpoints for all main functionality
  - Factory pattern implementation for proper dependency injection
  - Core risk management domain logic and controls
  - Consolidated authentication system using Clerk
  - Improved data flow with proper repository pattern usage
  - Secure key handling with mandatory encryption in production
  - Standardized database migrations using GORM AutoMigrate
  - Consolidated entity definitions and repository implementations
  - Comprehensive error handling with middleware
  - Structured logging with request tracking
  - Unit tests for key components
  - Detailed documentation of the refactoring process

## Recent Achievements

- Completed all major architectural refactoring efforts
- Standardized repository pattern, error handling, factory, middleware, and migrations
- Consolidated middleware implementations into a unified auth middleware
- Consolidated database migrations into a single approach using GORM AutoMigrate
- Removed mock and stub implementations from production code
- Fixed AI service implementations to match interface contracts
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/refactoring-summary.md`
- Updated system patterns and progress in memory bank
- Completed additional refactoring tasks:
  - Consolidated error handling middleware (kept UnifiedErrorMiddleware, removed StandardizedErrorHandler)
  - Consolidated logger implementations (kept feature-rich implementation in internal/logger/init.go)
  - Consolidated crypto utilities (kept feature-rich implementation in internal/util/crypto)
  - Consolidated wallet repository (kept ConsolidatedWalletRepository)
  - Created consolidated migrations file using GORM's AutoMigrate
- Ready to proceed with Risk Management System implementation
