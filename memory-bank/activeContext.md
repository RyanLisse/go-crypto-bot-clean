# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on the Trade Execution System (Task 6). We have successfully implemented the core components of the trade execution system including the order model, repository, trade service, HTTP handlers, and the TradeFactory for dependency injection.

### Completed
- Task 5: Position Management System
  - ✅ Task 5.1: Define position model and repository interface
  - ✅ Task 5.2: Implement position use cases and service layer
  - ✅ Task 5.3: Create HTTP API handlers and position visualization

- Task 6: Implement Trade Execution System
  - ✅ Task 6.1: Implement Order Model and Repository
  - ✅ Task 6.2: Develop MEXC API Integration Service
  - ✅ Task 6.3: Implement Trade Use Case and HTTP Handlers

### Next Steps

1. Begin Task 7: Implement Risk Management System
   - Task 7.1: Define risk model and repository interfaces
   - Task 7.2: Implement risk calculation algorithms
   - Task 7.3: Create risk management service
   - Task 7.4: Integrate risk constraints into trade execution flow

2. Additional tasks for future consideration:
   - Enhance test coverage for the Trade Execution System
   - Implement advanced order types (e.g., Stop Loss, Take Profit)
   - Create a transaction history system for audit/reporting

## General Project Context
- The backend implementation now includes:
  - Complete MEXC API integration for market data and trading
  - Position management system with database persistence
  - Trade execution system with order management and persistence
  - HTTP API endpoints for all main functionality
  - Factory pattern implementation for proper dependency injection

## Implementation Notes
- The Position Management System includes:
  - A comprehensive domain model with Position, PositionSide, and PositionStatus types
  - Repository implementations for all persistence operations
  - Use cases for creating, reading, updating, and closing positions
  - Service layer for business logic including position performance tracking
  - HTTP handlers implementing RESTful API endpoints for all position operations
  
- The Trade Execution System includes:
  - Order domain model with OrderSide, OrderType, OrderStatus, and TimeInForce enums
  - GORM-based OrderRepository for persistence with full CRUD operations
  - TradeUseCase implementation for business logic
  - TradeService for integration with MEXC exchange API
  - HTTP handlers for RESTful API endpoints supporting order operations
  - TradeFactory for properly managing dependencies and component creation

- The HTTP API endpoints for positions follow RESTful principles with these key routes:
  - POST /positions: Create a new position
  - GET /positions: List positions with filtering options
  - GET /positions/open: Get open positions
  - GET /positions/:id: Get a specific position
  - PUT /positions/:id: Update a position
  - PUT /positions/:id/close: Close a position
  - DELETE /positions/:id: Delete a position

- The HTTP API endpoints for trading include:
  - POST /trades/orders: Place a new order
  - DELETE /trades/orders/:symbol/:orderId: Cancel an order
  - GET /trades/orders/:symbol/:orderId: Get order status
  - GET /trades/orders/open/:symbol: Get open orders
  - GET /trades/orders/history/:symbol: Get order history
  - GET /trades/calculate/:symbol: Calculate required quantity

- All implementations include comprehensive unit tests
