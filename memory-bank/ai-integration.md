# AI Trading Assistant Integration

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the AI Trading Assistant with security features (Task #22).

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Components

#### 1. GORM Models for AI Conversation Storage
- Created a GORM model for conversation memories in `backend/internal/domain/ai/repository/gorm_memory.go`
- Implemented a GORM repository for storing and retrieving conversations
- Updated the factory to use GORM instead of raw SQL

#### 2. Drizzle Schema for Frontend Chat Persistence
- Created a Drizzle schema for conversations in `frontend/src/db/schema/conversations.ts`
- Implemented a conversation service using Drizzle in `frontend/src/services/conversationService.ts`
- Created React hooks for conversation management in `frontend/src/hooks/useConversation.ts` and `frontend/src/hooks/useConversationList.ts`

#### 3. Structured Prompt Templates
- Created a template system in `backend/internal/domain/ai/service/templates/`
- Implemented base template functionality with validation
- Created specialized templates for trade recommendations, market analysis, and portfolio optimization
- Implemented a template registry for managing templates

#### 4. Function Calling Framework
- Created a function registry in `backend/internal/domain/ai/service/function/registry.go`
- Implemented trading-specific functions in `backend/internal/domain/ai/service/function/trading_functions.go`
- Added function validation and execution

#### 5. Enhanced AI Service Interface
- Updated the AI service interface to support templates and functions
- Added methods for listing and managing conversations
- Implemented the new interface methods in the GeminiAIService

### Completed Components (continued)

#### 6. Risk Management Integration
- Connected AI assistant to the existing risk management system
- Implemented guardrails to prevent AI from suggesting high-risk actions
- Added confirmation flows for trades above certain thresholds
- Created GORM repository for trade confirmations
- Added API endpoints for risk management
- Integrated risk management with the AI service

### Pending Components

#### 7. Frontend Chat Interface
- Created a responsive chat interface with conversation persistence
- Implemented conversation history management
- Added support for rich content formatting in messages
- Created a chat page with responsive layout
- Integrated with backend API for chat functionality
- Added authentication context for user management

#### 8. Security Monitoring and Compliance System
- Implemented input sanitization and output filtering middleware
- Added audit logging system for tracking security events
- Created content validation service for AI responses
- Added encryption service for sensitive data
- Implemented rate limiting middleware
- Updated AI service to use security features
- Integrated security features with the server

#### 9. Vector Similarity Search
- Implemented vector embeddings for conversation messages using Gemini with OpenAI fallback
- Created similarity search functionality with Turso vector index
- Added API endpoints for indexing messages and finding similar conversations
- Implemented repository for managing embeddings
- Created a fallback mechanism to ensure embedding generation reliability

## Technical Decisions

1. Using GORM for backend database operations instead of raw SQL queries
2. Using Drizzle ORM with Turso for frontend data persistence
3. Implementing a template-based system for AI prompts to ensure consistency
4. Creating a function calling framework with validation and security controls
5. Planning to use Turso's native vector search capabilities for similarity search

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Risk Management Integration (task 22.4)
2. Complete the Frontend Chat Interface (task 22.6)
3. Implement Security Monitoring and Compliance System (task 22.7)
4. Begin work on Vector Similarity Search (task 23)
