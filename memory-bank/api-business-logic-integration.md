# API Integration with Business Logic

## Overview
Connected the RESTful API endpoints to the business logic of the trading bot by creating a service layer that acts as a bridge between the API handlers and the core business logic.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Service Layer
- Created service connectors for backtest, strategy, auth, and user management
- Implemented methods to convert between API models and business logic models
- Added error handling and validation

### 2. Backtest Service
- Connected backtest endpoints to the backtest service
- Implemented methods for running backtests, getting results, and comparing backtests
- Added conversion between API models and business logic models

### 3. Strategy Service
- Connected strategy endpoints to the strategy factory
- Implemented methods for listing strategies, getting details, and updating configurations
- Added support for enabling and disabling strategies

### 4. Authentication Service
- Connected auth endpoints to the auth service
- Implemented methods for login, registration, token refresh, and verification

- Added support for password management

### 6. Main Application
- Created a main entry point for the API server
- Initialized all services and connected them to the API handlers
- Added middleware for logging and error recovery

## Implementation Details
- Used a service provider pattern to manage service dependencies
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Added conversion between API models and business logic models
- Created a clean separation between API handlers and business logic

## Next Steps
- Implement authentication middleware to secure the API
- Add database integration for persistent storage
