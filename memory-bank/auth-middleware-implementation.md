# Authentication Middleware Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive authentication middleware using JWT tokens for securing the API endpoints. Added role-based access control to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.

## Components Implemented

### 1. JWT Service
- Created a service for generating and validating JWT tokens
- Implemented access and refresh token generation with proper expiration
- Added validation for token signature, expiration, and claims
- Implemented token blacklisting for logout functionality

### 2. Authentication Middleware
- Created middleware for authenticating requests using JWT tokens
- Implemented role-based access control for restricting access to endpoints
- Added helper functions for getting user information from the request context
- Created comprehensive tests for all middleware functionality

### 3. Main Application Integration
- Updated the main application to include the JWT service and authentication middleware
- Added environment variable configuration for JWT secrets and settings
- Implemented protected routes using the authentication middleware
- Added proper error handling for authentication failures

## Implementation Details
- Used the golang-jwt/jwt package for JWT token generation and validation
- Implemented proper error handling for various authentication scenarios
- Added comprehensive tests for all JWT and authentication functionality
- Created a clean separation between authentication and business logic

## Security Features
- Implemented separate secrets for access and refresh tokens
- Added token expiration with configurable TTL
- Implemented token blacklisting for logout functionality
- Added role-based access control for restricting access to endpoints
- Used proper JWT signing methods and validation

## Next Steps
- Implement database integration for user management
- Add password hashing and validation
- Implement token refresh functionality in the API
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Implement audit logging for authentication events
