# Database Integration Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive database integration for the API using GORM as the ORM. Added models, repositories, and tests for users, strategies, and backtests.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Models
- Created user models for authentication and user management
- Implemented strategy models for trading strategy configuration
- Added backtest models for storing backtest results and trades
- Designed a flexible schema with proper relationships between models

### 2. Database Configuration
- Created a database configuration system with environment variable support
- Implemented connection pooling for optimal performance
- Added logging and debugging capabilities
- Created a migration manager for database schema updates

### 3. Repositories
- Implemented repository interfaces for all models
- Created GORM implementations of the repositories
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation
- Implemented proper transaction management

### 4. Service Integration
- Updated services to use the repositories
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Added database-backed authentication and user management
- Connected the API endpoints to the database repositories

## Implementation Details
- Used GORM as the ORM for database operations
- Implemented soft deletes for all models
- Added proper indexing for optimal query performance
- Created comprehensive tests for all repositories
- Used SQLite for development and testing

## Database Schema
- **Users**: Stores user information, credentials, and settings
- **Strategies**: Stores trading strategy configurations and parameters
- **Backtests**: Stores backtest results, trades, and performance metrics

## Next Steps
- Implement database migrations for production deployment
- Add more advanced query capabilities
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add database-backed logging and auditing
- Implement database-backed rate limiting
