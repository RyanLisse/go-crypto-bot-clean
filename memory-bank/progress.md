# Project Progress

## Overall Progress
- Total tasks: 7 major tasks with multiple subtasks
- Tasks completed: 6 major tasks (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
- Current progress: ~85% complete

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Project Setup and Architecture Design âœ…
- Defined hexagonal architecture
- Set up project structure
- Established dependency management
- Created initial repository

### Task 2: MEXC Exchange API Integration âœ…
- Implemented MEXC REST client with API key management
- Implemented adapter pattern with retry mechanism
- Implemented rate limiting
- Added endpoints for market data, account info, and trading

### Task 3: Database Layer Implementation âœ…
- Implemented GORM repositories for all entities
- Created migration system
- Implemented caching layer for market data
- Added proper error handling and logging

### Task 4: Market Data Processing âœ…
- Implemented market data fetching from MEXC
- Created symbol synchronization
- Added historical data storage

- Implemented position use cases and service layer
- Created HTTP API handlers and position visualization

### Task 6: Trade Execution System âœ…
- âœ… Task 6.1: Implement Order Model and Repository
- âœ… Task 6.2: Develop MEXC API Integration Service
- âœ… Task 6.3: Implement Trade Use Case and HTTP Handlers
- âœ… Implemented TradeFactory for dependency injection

## In Progress Tasks
- None currently. Ready to begin Task 7.

## Pending Tasks
### Task 7: Risk Management System ðŸ”œ
- Task 7.1: Define risk model and repository interfaces
- Task 7.2: Implement risk calculation algorithms
- Task 7.3: Create risk management service
- Task 7.4: Integrate risk constraints into trade execution flow

## Known Issues
- Need to update test coverage for new trade execution functionality
- Some edge cases in error handling from the MEXC API may need refinement

## Next Milestones
1. Begin implementation of Risk Management System
2. Perform final end-to-end testing of the complete trading flow
3. Enhance the system with advanced order types (Stop Loss, Take Profit)

## Technical Debt
- Need to enhance test coverage across all implemented components
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect completed implementations
- Consider performance optimizations for market data processing
- Review error handling consistency across the application

## Risks and Mitigation
- Integration between position management and trade execution systems may require careful planning
- Mitigation: Ensure clear interface definitions and thorough testing of integrations
- Market data processing might face performance issues with large volumes of data
- Mitigation: Implement efficient caching strategies and consider data aggregation approaches

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully completed the Trade Execution System with:
  - Order domain model with full implementation
  - GORM-based OrderRepository for persistence with all required operations
  - TradeUseCase implementation for business logic
  - TradeService for integration with MEXC exchange API
  - HTTP handlers for RESTful API endpoints for all order operations
  - Factory pattern implementation for proper dependency injection
- Proper integration between trade execution system and the main application
- Established database migration for order entities
