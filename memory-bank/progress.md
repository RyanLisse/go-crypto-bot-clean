# Progress Report

## Current Status
- Task ID 6 Verification: Successfully verified implementation. All tests passed for error handling in backend/internal/repository/gorm_portfolio_repository.go.
- Task ID 8 Completion: Successfully optimized caching strategy; all subtasks (8.1 through 8.5) completed and verified.
- Task ID 10 Completion: Successfully set up logging and monitoring; all subtasks (10.1 through 10.6) completed and verified. Attempt to update status failed, but subtasks are done.
- Task ID 11 Completion: Successfully implemented API key management; all subtasks (11.1 through 11.5) completed and verified.
- Task ID 9 Completion: Successfully implemented comprehensive testing suite; all subtasks (9.1 through 9.5) completed and verified, though the task-master command still shows it as pending.

## Known Issues
- Command 'task-master set-status --id=10 --status=done' failed previously. Task ID 9 subtasks are complete, but the main task status may not have updated.

## Overall Project Progress
[Updated: Task ID 9 is now complete based on subtask results. Retain existing content from previous versions if applicable, ensuring this update is appended or integrated appropriately.]

## Next Actions
- Attempt to set Task ID 9 status to done using 'task-master set-status --id=9 --status=done'.
