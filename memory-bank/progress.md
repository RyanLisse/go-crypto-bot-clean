# Progress Report

## Current Status
- Task ID 6 Verification: Successfully verified implementation. All tests passed for error handling in backend/internal/repository/gorm_portfolio_repository.go.
- Task ID 8 Completion: Successfully optimized caching strategy; all subtasks (8.1 through 8.5) completed and verified.
- Task ID 10 Completion: Successfully set up logging and monitoring; all subtasks (10.1 through 10.6) completed and verified. Attempt to update status failed, but subtasks are done.
- Task ID 11 Completion: Successfully implemented API key management; all subtasks (11.1 through 11.5) completed and verified.
- Task ID 9 Completion: Successfully implemented comprehensive testing suite; all subtasks (9.1 through 9.5) completed and verified, though the task-master command still shows it as pending.
- Backend Fixes: Resolved critical type errors and implemented missing interfaces in the backend code. Backend now builds successfully.
- GitHub Push: Successfully resolved the API key issue by removing .env.taskmaster from Git history using git filter-branch and pushed changes to GitHub.
- Task ID 2.7 Progress: Implemented key MexcAPI interface methods for order management (PlaceOrder, GetOrderStatus, CancelOrder) with proper request signing, parameter handling, and error management.

## Known Issues
- Command 'task-master set-status --id=10 --status=done' failed previously. Task ID 9 subtasks are complete, but the main task status may not have updated.

## Overall Project Progress
[Updated: Successfully fixed backend code issues, resolved GitHub push blocking issue, and made significant progress on Task ID 2.7 by implementing the MexcAPI interface order-related functionality. The API client has been enhanced with proper request signing, parameter handling, and error management following cryptocurrency exchange API best practices. Implementation remains structurally sound and builds successfully.]

## Next Actions
- Continue implementing remaining MexcAPI methods
- Develop comprehensive tests for the API client implementation
- Consider implementing websocket connectivity for real-time market data
- Update task-master status for completed tasks and subtasks
