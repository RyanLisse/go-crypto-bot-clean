# Project Progress

## Overall Status
The project has made significant progress with several key components now implemented. The Position Management System implementation is now complete. The next focus will be on implementing the Trade Execution System.

## Completed Milestones

- Core Project Setup (Task 1)
- Domain Model Implementation (Task 2)
- Database Integration (Task 3)
- Market Data System (Task 4)
- Position Management System (Task 5)

## Completed Tasks
- Core project structure and architecture setup (Task ID 1)
- MEXC API client implementation (Task ID 2)
- Database setup and repository implementation (Task ID 3)
- Market data fetching and processing (Task ID 4)
- Position management system implementation (Task ID 5)
  - Position domain model and repository implementation (Task ID 5.1)
  - Position management use cases and service implementation (Task ID 5.2)
  - Position API endpoints and visualization (Task ID 5.3)

## In Progress Tasks
- None currently. Planning to start on Trade Execution System (Task ID 6)

## Pending Tasks
- Trade execution system (Task ID 6)
- Strategy implementation (Task ID 7)
- Backtesting and simulation (Task ID 8)
- User authentication and authorization (Task ID 9)
- Deployment and CI/CD (Task ID 10)

## Next Actions
1. Begin implementation of the Trade Execution System (Task ID 6)
   - Define domain models for trade execution
   - Implement trade execution service
   - Create repositories and use cases for trade management
   - Develop HTTP API endpoints
2. Ensure proper integration between Position Management and Trade Execution systems
3. Continue regular testing and documentation updates

## Technical Debt
- Need to enhance test coverage across all implemented components
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect completed implementations
- Consider performance optimizations for market data processing
- Review error handling consistency across the application

## Risks and Mitigation
- Integration between position management and trade execution systems may require careful planning
- Mitigation: Ensure clear interface definitions and thorough testing of integrations
- Market data processing might face performance issues with large volumes of data
- Mitigation: Implement efficient caching strategies and consider data aggregation approaches

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully completed the Position Management System with:
  - Comprehensive domain model and repository implementation
  - Well-structured use cases and service layer components
  - Complete HTTP API endpoints for all position operations
- Established proper integration between market data and position management components
- Achieved good test coverage across all position management components
