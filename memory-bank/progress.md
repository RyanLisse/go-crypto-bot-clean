## New Milestone: Frontend-Backend Integration & API Standardization (June 2024)
- ✅ All frontend API calls now use `VITE_API_URL` and `/api/v1/auth/*` endpoints
- ✅ Backend CORS and environment config aligned for local/prod
- ✅ Service-level and repository-level integration tests pass
- 🟡 Component and E2E tests require environment fixes (missing dependencies, DOM setup)
- ⏭️ Next: Fix test environment, ensure all tests pass, document any remaining blockers

## Frontend Migration Progress (June 2024)
- 2024-06-10: Subtask 14.2 complete. Migrated project structure and configuration files for Next.js + Bun + Tailwind. Created tailwind.config.ts, verified all config files, fixed linter errors, and ensured structure matches migration guide. Ready for file-based routing and further migration steps.
- 2024-06-10: Subtask 14.3 complete. Implemented file-based routing system for dashboard pages in Next.js frontend. Created (dashboard) route group, placeholder pages, and layout. Structure matches migration guide.
- 2024-06-10: Subtask 14.4 update. Added global Toaster (Sonner) to root layout for notifications, following the migration guide. Sonner toasts are now available app-wide.

## BruteBot AI Chat Implementation (April 2024)
**Status: In Progress**

- 2024-04-16: Started implementing BruteBot AI chat functionality in the backend
  - Examined the AI handler, usecase, service, factory, and domain model implementations
  - Identified issues with the AI chat endpoint not being accessible
  - Attempted to test the endpoint with curl but received 404 errors
  - Next steps: Debug route registration, verify AI handler implementation, and fix configuration issues
