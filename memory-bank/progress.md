# Progress Report

## Current Status
- Task ID 6 Verification: Successfully verified implementation. All tests passed for error handling in backend/internal/repository/gorm_portfolio_repository.go.
- Task ID 8 Completion: Successfully optimized caching strategy; all subtasks (8.1 through 8.5) completed and verified.
- Task ID 10 Completion: Successfully set up logging and monitoring; all subtasks (10.1 through 10.6) completed and verified. Attempt to update status failed, but subtasks are done.
- Task ID 11 Completion: Successfully implemented API key management; all subtasks (11.1 through 11.5) completed and verified.
- Task ID 9 Completion: Successfully implemented comprehensive testing suite; all subtasks (9.1 through 9.5) completed and verified, though the task-master command still shows it as pending.
- Backend Fixes: Resolved critical type errors and implemented missing interfaces in the backend code. Backend now builds successfully.
- GitHub Push: Successfully resolved the API key issue by removing .env.taskmaster from Git history using git filter-branch and pushed changes to GitHub.
- Task ID 2.7 Completion: âœ… Successfully completed implementation of the MexcAPI interface with proper rate limiting. Implemented all required methods (GetAccount, GetMarketData, GetKlines, GetOrderBook, PlaceOrder, CancelOrder, GetOrderStatus) following the interface contract. All tests are now passing.

## Known Issues
- Command 'task-master set-status --id=10 --status=done' failed previously. Task ID 9 subtasks are complete, but the main task status may not have updated.

## Overall Project Progress
[Updated: Successfully completed Task 2.7 - Implementation of MexcAPI interface with REST client and rate limiting. The MexcAPI interface is now fully implemented with all required methods properly handling API responses and respecting rate limits. The REST client implementation is complete with proper authentication, request signing, and JSON parsing. Rate limiting is implemented using the TokenBucket algorithm to prevent exceeding API request limits. All tests for the REST client are now passing, confirming that the implementation works as expected. The next task (2.8) will focus on enhancing API key management and error handling with retry mechanisms.]

## Next Actions
- Begin implementing Task 2.8 - Secure API key management and error handling
- Develop more comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms
- Add integration tests for the API client implementation when possible
- Document the API client usage and rate limiting approach
- Update task-master status for subsequent tasks as they are completed
