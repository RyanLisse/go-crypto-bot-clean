- ‚úÖ Database integration with GORM
- ‚úÖ Environment configuration system
- ‚úÖ Logging system with zerolog
- ‚úÖ MEXC exchange API integration
- ‚úÖ Market data fetching from MEXC
- ‚úÖ Position management system with database persistence
- ‚úÖ New Coin Detection and AutoBuy system (Event-Driven)
- ‚úÖ Trade Execution System with order management and persistence

## Tasks in Progress

### Task 7: Risk Management System
**Status: In Progress**

The Risk Management System is designed to evaluate and control trading risks based on user-defined risk profiles and constraints.

Subtasks:
1. ‚úÖ Implement Risk Control Models and Core Domain Logic
   - ‚úÖ Implement risk control models (Concentration, Liquidity, Exposure, Drawdown, Volatility, Position Size)
   - ‚úÖ Create RiskEvaluator to coordinate multiple risk controls
   - ‚úÖ Develop BaseRiskControl for common functionality
   - ‚úÖ Define risk profiles (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
   - ‚úÖ Create domain models and interfaces
   - ‚úÖ Implement control evaluation logic for different risk types

2. üîÑ Develop Risk Management Repository and Persistence Layer
   - ‚¨ú Design database schema for risk assessments, profiles, and constraints
   - ‚¨ú Implement repositories for risk-related entities (RiskAssessmentRepository, RiskMetricsRepository, RiskConstraintRepository)
   - ‚¨ú Create database migrations with proper relationships and indices
   - ‚¨ú Implement GORM-based implementations of the repositories
   - ‚¨ú Set up risk parameter persistence

3. ‚¨ú Implement Risk Use Case and Trade Validation Integration
   - ‚¨ú Develop RiskService for core business logic
   - ‚¨ú Create RiskUseCase for application-level operations
   - ‚¨ú Integrate risk evaluation with trade execution flow
   - ‚¨ú Implement pre-trade risk checks in TradeUseCase
   - ‚¨ú Create position sizing logic based on risk parameters
   - ‚¨ú Implement interfaces for risk profile management

4. ‚¨ú Create Risk Management API Endpoints
   - ‚¨ú Develop RiskHandler for HTTP API endpoints
   - ‚¨ú Create endpoints for risk profile management
   - ‚¨ú Implement endpoints for risk assessment queries
   - ‚¨ú Develop documentation for risk API

5. ‚¨ú Implement Risk Notification System
   - ‚¨ú Create risk event publishing mechanism
   - ‚¨ú Develop notification templates
   - ‚¨ú Implement delivery methods (email, in-app)

## Upcoming Tasks

- Task 8: Backtesting System
- Task 9: Strategy Management System
- Task 10: System Status and Monitoring

## Known Issues/Blockers
- MEXC API has rate limits that need to be managed carefully
- Need comprehensive test coverage for risk control evaluation
- Need to design proper indices for risk assessment queries

## Next Steps
- Complete the Risk Management Repository implementation (Subtask 7.2)
- Create database migrations for risk management tables
- Enhance error handling for risk evaluation
- Begin work on the Risk Use Case implementation once repositories are ready

## Technical Debt
- Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Enhance test coverage for risk controls
- Refactor some market data service methods for better performance
- Documentation improvements for risk management API

## New Milestone: Frontend-Backend Integration & API Standardization (June 2024)
- ‚úÖ All frontend API calls now use `VITE_API_URL` and `/api/v1/auth/*` endpoints
- ‚úÖ Backend CORS and environment config aligned for local/prod
- ‚úÖ Service-level and repository-level integration tests pass
- üü° Component and E2E tests require environment fixes (missing dependencies, DOM setup)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Fix test environment, ensure all tests pass, document any remaining blockers

- 2024-06-10: Subtask 14.2 complete. Migrated project structure and configuration files for Next.js + Bun + Tailwind. Created tailwind.config.ts, verified all config files, fixed linter errors, and ensured structure matches migration guide. Ready for file-based routing and further migration steps.
- 2024-06-10: Subtask 14.3 complete. Implemented file-based routing system for dashboard pages in Next.js frontend. Created (dashboard) route group, placeholder pages, and layout. Structure matches migration guide.
- 2024-06-10: Subtask 14.4 update. Added global Toaster (Sonner) to root layout for notifications, following the migration guide. Sonner toasts are now available app-wide.
