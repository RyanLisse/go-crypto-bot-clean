Okay, let's review this Go backend codebase before you start refactoring. Based on the provided file structure and code snippets, here's an analysis focusing on anomalies, redundancy, data flow, API versions, and overall cleanliness.

**Executive Summary**

The codebase generally follows clean architecture principles with a clear separation of concerns (domain, application, infrastructure). However, there are several areas with significant redundancy, potential inconsistencies, and critical issues in the data flow path that prevent fetching real data from the MEXC exchange. Key areas for improvement before refactoring include: consolidating duplicate packages (factories, repositories), streamlining the `cmd` vs. `scripts` structure, fixing the MEXC client to use live API calls instead of sample/hardcoded data, removing direct API calls from HTTP handlers, simplifying the authentication middleware strategy, and standardizing the database migration approach. Addressing these points will provide a much cleaner and more reliable foundation for refactoring.

**Detailed Findings & Recommendations**

**1. Code Structure & Redundancy (Severity: High)**

*   **Issue:** Duplicate `factory` packages (`internal/adapter/factory` and `internal/factory`).
    *   `internal/adapter/factory` seems to contain specific factories (like `WalletFactory`) that overlap or conflict with methods potentially belonging in the main `internal/factory`.
    *   `internal/factory` appears more aligned with creating domain/usecase layer components.
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate all component creation logic into the `internal/factory` package. Remove `internal/adapter/factory`. Ensure clear separation based on the layer the factory serves (e.g., `RepositoryFactory`, `UseCaseFactory`, `DeliveryFactory` within `internal/factory`).

*   **Issue:** Duplicate `repository/gorm` packages (`internal/adapter/repository/gorm` and `internal/adapter/persistence/gorm/repo`).
    *   The structure `internal/adapter/persistence/gorm/repo` is more conventional for holding specific repository implementations. `internal/adapter/repository/gorm` seems redundant.
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate all GORM repository implementations into `internal/adapter/persistence/gorm/repo`. Remove `internal/adapter/repository/gorm`.

*   **Issue:** Redundant `cmd` vs. `scripts` structure.
    *   Many executables in `cmd/` have corresponding files in `scripts/` (e.g., `cmd/migrate` vs. `scripts/run_migrations.go`).
    *   The `cmd/` files often contain only TODO comments indicating the logic is in `scripts/`.
*   **Recommendation:** Eliminate the `scripts/` directory for Go code. Move all executable logic into the respective `cmd/` packages. If there's shared logic, place it in an appropriate `internal/` package and call it from the `cmd` main functions. Command-line tools belong in `cmd/`.

*   **Issue:** Potential redundancy in Wallet Repositories.
    *   `internal/adapter/persistence/gorm/wallet_repository.go` seems misplaced given the `repo/` subdirectory structure.
    *   `internal/adapter/persistence/gorm/repo/wallet_repository.go` contains comments indicating it's a placeholder and `ConsolidatedWalletRepository` should be used.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove the potentially misplaced `gorm/wallet_repository.go`. Ensure `ConsolidatedWalletRepository` (which seems to be the intended enhanced version based on `enhanced_wallet.go` entity and migrations) is correctly implemented and used everywhere the `port.WalletRepository` interface is required. Remove the placeholder `repo/wallet_repository.go` or update it to be the final implementation.

*   **Issue:** Dual crypto packages (`internal/crypto` and `internal/util/crypto`).
    *   `internal/crypto` seems focused on credential encryption.
    *   `internal/util/crypto` is more comprehensive, including factories, managers, and different encryption service implementations.
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate all cryptography-related code into a single package, preferably `internal/crypto`. The structure in `internal/util/crypto` (factories, managers, services) appears more robust. Migrate the credential-specific logic into this consolidated package and remove `internal/util/crypto`.

*   **Issue:** Entity definition duplication/inconsistency.
    *   `entity/api_credential_entity.go` vs `entity/api_credential.go`.
    *   `entity/wallet_entity.go` (empty) vs `entity/wallet.go`.
    *   `entity/enhanced_wallet.go` exists, suggesting refactoring attempts (like `consolidate_wallet_tables` migration).
*   **Recommendation:** Clean up entity definitions. Decide on a single definitive entity struct for each concept (e.g., use `entity.APICredential` and remove `APICredentialEntity`). Remove the empty `wallet_entity.go`. Ensure the `EnhancedWalletEntity` and related balance/history entities are the canonical ones used by the `ConsolidatedWalletRepository`.

*   **Issue:** Naming inconsistency (`handler` vs. `controller`).
    *   Packages exist under `adapter/delivery/http/handler` and `adapter/http/controller`.
*   **Recommendation:** Standardize on one naming convention. `handler` is common in Go for HTTP request handlers, but `controller` can also be used, especially if following MVC patterns. Choose one and apply it consistently.

*   **Issue:** Potentially unnecessary adapter: `internal/adapter/market/market_adapter.go`.
    *   This adapts `service.MarketDataService` to `port.MarketDataService`. Ideally, the service implementation should directly implement the port interface.
*   **Recommendation:** Review if this adapter is truly necessary. If `service.MarketDataService` can implement `port.MarketDataService` directly, remove the adapter to reduce complexity.

**2. Data Flow & Mock Data (Severity: Critical)**

*   **Issue:** MEXC Client returning sample/hardcoded data.
    *   `pkg/platform/mexc/client.go`'s `GetAccount` method explicitly checks for `sample_balance.go` or `sample_balance.json` and returns data from those *or* falls back to hardcoded data. The actual API call logic is commented out.
    *   `pkg/platform/mexc/sample_balance.go` exists to provide this sample data.
    *   `scripts/mexc/sample/create_sample_balance.go` further supports creating this sample data.
*   **Recommendation:** **This is critical.** Modify `pkg/platform/mexc/client.go` (`GetAccount` and potentially other methods) to *always* attempt the live API call. Remove the logic that loads from sample files or uses hardcoded data. The sample data generation can remain in `scripts` or `cmd` for testing setup, but the core client *must* use the live API.

*   **Issue:** Direct API calls from HTTP handlers.
    *   `MarketDataHandler` contains methods like `GetDirectTicker`, `GetDirectOrderBook`, `GetDirectSymbols`, `GetDirectCandles` which call the `mexcClient` directly.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove these "Direct" methods from the handler. All data retrieval should go through the Use Case (or Service) layer, which orchestrates fetching from cache, repository, or the external API gateway (client) as needed. Direct calls from the handler violate clean architecture and bypass caching/persistence logic.

*   **Issue:** Mock data provider used.
    *   `internal/adapter/gateway/mexc/market_data_provider.go` explicitly returns mock data for Ticker, Candles, OrderBook, Symbols.
*   **Recommendation:** Replace the use of this mock provider in the application setup (`di/container.go` or factories) with the real implementation (e.g., `mexcGateway.MEXCGateway` which uses the actual `mexcClient`).

*   **Issue:** Multiple layers handling data fetching fallback.
    *   `MarketDataServiceWithErrorHandling` seems to add fallback logic (cache -> base service -> API).
    *   The `MarketDataUseCase` also appears to have cache/DB fallback logic.
    *   The `MarketDataHandler` has direct API fallback logic (which should be removed).
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate fallback logic into a single layer, ideally the `MarketDataService` or `MarketDataUseCase`. The flow should consistently be: check cache -> check repository -> fetch from external API -> update repository & cache.

**3. API/SDK Versions (Severity: Medium)**

*   **Clerk:** `go.mod` uses `github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2 v2.3.0`.
    *   **Action:** Check the official Clerk Go SDK repository for the latest stable v2 release. As of mid-2024, v2.x releases are ongoing. Update if a newer stable version is available.
*   **MEXC:** No specific SDK used; custom implementation targets `/api/v3`.
    *   **Action:** Verify on the official MEXC API documentation that `/api/v3` is still the current recommended stable version for the spot market. Ensure error handling correctly parses v3 error formats.
*   **TursoDB:** `go.mod` uses `github.com/tursodatabase/go-libsql v0.0.0-20250401...`.
    *   **Action:** This version seems very recent (pseudo-version based on a commit date). Check the `tursodatabase/go-libsql` repository for the latest official tagged release and update `go.mod` to use it if available and stable. Using tagged releases is generally preferred over pseudo-versions.

**4. Authentication & Security (Severity: Medium)**

*   **Issue:** Multiple Authentication Middlewares.
    *   `SimpleAuthMiddleware`, `ClerkMiddleware`, `EnhancedClerkMiddleware`, `TestAuthMiddleware`, `MEXCAPIMiddleware`. This is complex. `AuthFactory` in `adapter/http/middleware` seems to temporarily create `MEXCAPIMiddleware` instead of Clerk middleware.
*   **Recommendation:** Clarify the primary authentication strategy (likely Clerk). Remove unused or temporary middleware. `MEXCAPIMiddleware` which adds API keys to context seems like a misuse of auth middleware; consider a different mechanism if needed (e.g., fetching credentials within the service layer based on user ID from context). Simplify the `AuthFactory` logic.

*   **Issue:** Encryption Key Handling.
    *   `internal/util/crypto/crypto.go`'s `init` function tries to load `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the environment but falls back to a *zero key* if it fails. Using a predictable/zero key is highly insecure.
    *   API secrets are intended to be encrypted (comments in entities, crypto packages exist).
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is *mandatory* in production environments. The application should fail to start if the key is missing or invalid. Remove the zero-key fallback. Verify that `APICredentialRepository.Save` consistently encrypts the `APISecret` before saving and that retrieval methods decrypt it correctly. Ensure the key management (`internal/util/crypto/key_manager.go`, `key_registry.go`) is robust.

*   **Issue:** Secret Management.
*   **Recommendation:** Confirm that all secrets (Clerk keys, MEXC keys, Encryption key, DB credentials if applicable) are loaded from environment variables or a secure configuration management system, not hardcoded. The `.env` loading and `EnvManager` in `util/crypto` are good steps.

**5. Database Migrations (Severity: Low/Info)**

*   **Issue:** Mixed migration strategies.
    *   GORM AutoMigrate seems to be used (`db.go`, `test_database_schema.go`).
    *   A custom `Migrator` exists (`migrations/migrator.go`).
    *   Numbered Goose migration files also exist (`migrations/027_*.go` onwards), along with `*_wrapper.go` files seemingly trying to bridge Goose and the custom migrator.
*   **Recommendation:** Standardize on a single migration approach.
    *   For simplicity during development, GORM AutoMigrate might suffice, but it has limitations for complex changes or rollbacks.
    *   For production, Goose (or a similar tool like `migrate`) provides better control. Remove the custom `Migrator` and the `*_wrapper.go` files if choosing Goose. Ensure all schema changes are captured in sequential Goose migration files. If sticking with GORM AutoMigrate, remove the Goose files and custom migrator.

**6. Error Handling (Severity: Low/Info)**

*   **Good:** Use of a custom `apperror` package and standardized error handling middleware (`StandardizedErrorHandler`) is good practice.
*   **Potential Issue:** `CredentialErrorService` seems overly specific. Handling credential errors might be better integrated into the standard error handling flow or the relevant use case/service error returns.
*   **Recommendation:** Review if the `CredentialErrorService` adds significant value or if its logic can be simplified and merged into the standard error handling or repository/service layers. Ensure consistent use of `apperror` across all handlers and use cases.

**7. Deprecated Packages (Severity: Low/Info)**

*   **Issue:** `pkg/ratelimiter` and `pkg/retry` are explicitly marked for migration.
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure these packages are no longer used anywhere in the codebase. Verify that `golang.org/x/time/rate` and `github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4` (which are in `go.mod`) are used correctly in their place for rate limiting and retry logic, respectively. Remove the deprecated packages from `pkg/`.

**Conclusion**

The codebase has a decent foundation based on clean architecture principles. However, significant cleanup is required before proceeding with major refactoring. The most critical actions are:

1.  **Fix Data Flow:** Ensure the MEXC client uses the live API, remove direct API calls from handlers, and consolidate data fetching/fallback logic.
2.  **Consolidate Redundancy:** Merge duplicate factory and repository packages, and eliminate the `scripts` directory for Go code.
3.  **Simplify Authentication:** Choose a primary authentication strategy and remove/refactor the extra middleware.
4.  **Secure Key Handling:** Ensure the encryption key is mandatory and securely managed.
5.  **Standardize Migrations:** Select one migration strategy (GORM AutoMigrate or Goose) and remove the others.

Addressing these points will create a cleaner, more reliable, and easier-to-maintain backend, setting a solid stage for future refactoring efforts.
