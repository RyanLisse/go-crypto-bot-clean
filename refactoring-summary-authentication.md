# Refactoring Summary: Simplifying Authentication

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a Consolidated Authentication Middleware

- Created a unified `ConsolidatedAuthMiddleware` in `backend/internal/adapter/http/middleware/consolidated_auth_middleware.go`
- Implemented the `AuthMiddleware` interface with proper methods:
  - `Middleware()` - Validates authentication tokens
  - `RequireAuthentication()` - Ensures a user is authenticated
  - `RequireRole()` - Ensures a user has a specific role

### 2. Updated the Auth Factory

- Simplified the `AuthFactory` to use the consolidated middleware
- Removed temporary code that was using MEXC API middleware
- Added proper environment-based middleware selection

### 3. Fixed Context Key Types

- Updated context keys to use proper type-safe keys:
  - `UserIDKey{}` instead of string-based keys
  - `RoleKey{}` instead of string-based keys
- Ensured consistent context value access across middleware

### 4. Standardized on Clerk Authentication

- Made Clerk the primary authentication provider
- Ensured proper token validation and user retrieval
- Maintained test authentication for development/testing environments

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Security**:
   - Consistent authentication checks
   - Type-safe context keys
   - Proper token validation

2. **Better Maintainability**:
   - Single source of truth for authentication logic
   - Clear middleware hierarchy
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase

3. **Enhanced Flexibility**:
   - Easy to switch between authentication providers
   - Support for role-based access control
   - Environment-specific authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Update References**:
   - Update service and handler code to use the consolidated middleware
   - Update dependency injection container to use the auth factory

2. **Clean Up Redundant Files**:
   - Remove the redundant middleware implementations:
     - `clerk_middleware.go`
     - `enhanced_clerk_middleware.go`
     - `enhanced_clerk_middleware_wrapper.go`
     - `simple_auth_middleware.go`

3. **Add Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for the consolidated middleware
   - Create integration tests for authentication flow
