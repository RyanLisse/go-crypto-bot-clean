# Refactoring Summary: Secure Key Handling

## Changes Made

### 1. Made Encryption Key Mandatory in Production

- Updated `createKeyManager()` in `backend/internal/util/crypto/encryption_factory.go` to:
  - Require `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable in production environments
  - Generate a temporary key with a warning message in development environments
  - Provide better error messages for invalid keys

### 2. Improved Key Validation

- Enhanced validation of encryption keys:
  - Proper length checking (must be exactly 32 bytes)
  - Better error messages for invalid key format
  - Explicit base64 decoding error handling

### 3. Added Secure Fallback for Development

- Implemented a secure fallback for development environments:
  - Generates a temporary key when `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is not set
  - Displays clear warning messages about the insecurity of using temporary keys
  - Ensures the temporary key is cryptographically secure

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Security**:
   - Prevents accidental use of default keys in production
   - Ensures proper key length and format
   - Provides clear error messages for misconfiguration

2. **Better Developer Experience**:
   - Allows development without requiring key configuration
   - Provides helpful warning messages
   - Generates secure temporary keys automatically

3. **Enhanced Robustness**:
   - Better error handling for key-related issues
   - Clear distinction between production and development requirements
   - Improved logging of key-related problems

## Next Steps

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Document the requirement for `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production
   - Provide instructions for generating secure keys
   - Update deployment guides to include key management

2. **Consider Key Rotation**:
   - Implement a key rotation mechanism
   - Add support for multiple active keys
   - Create a migration path for re-encrypting data with new keys

3. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Add monitoring for encryption key usage
   - Create alerts for missing or invalid keys
   - Implement logging for encryption/decryption operations
