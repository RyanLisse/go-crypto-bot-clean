# Refactoring Summary: Standardizing Migrations

## Changes Made

### 1. Standardized on GORM AutoMigrate

- Created a unified migration system in `backend/internal/adapter/persistence/gorm/migrations/auto_migrate.go`
- Implemented `AutoMigrateModels` function to handle all entity migrations
- Ensured all entity models are included in the migration process

### 2. Updated Migration Command

- Updated the dedicated migration command in `backend/cmd/migrate/main.go`
- Implemented proper configuration loading and database connection
- Added comprehensive logging for migration operations

### 3. Removed Redundant Migration Methods

- Deprecated the SQL-based migration script in `backend/scripts/run_migrations.go`
- Consolidated all migration logic into a single, consistent approach
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing database schemas

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Simplified Development Workflow**:
   - Single, consistent approach to database migrations
   - No need to maintain separate SQL migration files
   - Reduced context switching between Go code and SQL

2. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Schema changes are directly tied to entity definitions
   - Automatic handling of new models and schema updates
   - Centralized migration logic for easier updates

3. **Better Onboarding Experience**:
   - New developers only need to run a single command
   - Clear documentation on the migration strategy
   - Consistent approach across all environments

## Next Steps

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update the migration documentation to reflect the standardized approach
   - Provide examples of common migration scenarios
   - Document the migration command usage

2. **Add Migration Tests**:
   - Create tests for the migration process
   - Ensure all entity models are properly migrated
   - Verify backward compatibility with existing data

3. **Consider Advanced Migration Features**:
   - Add support for data migrations
   - Implement version tracking for schema changes
   - Create tools for schema validation
