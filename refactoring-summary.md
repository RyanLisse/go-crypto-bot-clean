# Refactoring Summary: Data Flow Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed MEXC Client to Use Live API Calls

- Updated `GetAccount` method in `backend/pkg/platform/mexc/client.go` to use the live API instead of sample data
- Removed `sample_balance.go` file since we're now using live API calls
- Added proper error handling and logging for API calls

### 2. Removed Direct API Calls from HTTP Handlers

- Refactored `MarketDataHandler` in `backend/internal/adapter/delivery/http/handler/market_data_handler.go`:
  - Removed direct API endpoints (`/direct/...`) that bypassed the service layer
  - Updated handler methods to use the use case layer consistently
  - Removed fallback logic that made direct API calls

### 3. Consolidated Data Fetching Logic

- Updated `MarketDataProvider` in `backend/internal/adapter/gateway/mexc/market_data_provider.go`:
  - Added proper integration with the MEXC client
  - Implemented proper conversion between model types
  - Added temporary mock implementations for methods that need further work

### 4. Added Repository Support for Market Data

- Created `MarketDataRepository` interface in `backend/internal/domain/port/repository.go`
- Implemented `MarketDataRepository` in `backend/internal/adapter/repository/gorm/market_data_repository.go`

## Next Steps

1. **Complete MEXC Client Integration**:
   - Update the remaining methods in the market data provider to use the MEXC client
   - Fix any type conversion issues between the client and domain models

2. **Implement Repository Usage**:
   - Update the market data provider to use the repository for caching and persistence
   - Add proper transaction handling for database operations

3. **Add Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for the MEXC client
   - Create integration tests for the market data provider
   - Create end-to-end tests for the market data handler

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation to reflect the changes
   - Add examples of how to use the market data API

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Architecture**:
   - Clear separation of concerns between layers
   - Consistent data flow from API to database
   - Proper use of the repository pattern

2. **Better Maintainability**:
   - Removed duplicate code
   - Centralized error handling
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase

3. **Enhanced Reliability**:
   - Direct integration with the MEXC API
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Consistent data model throughout the application
