# Go Crypto Bot Backend Audit Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Go-based cryptocurrency trading bot backend that implements a clean architecture with repository pattern. The code is organized following domain-driven design principles.

## Audit Focus
Please focus on the following aspects:

1. **Repository Pattern Implementation**:
   - Evaluate the implementation of the repository pattern
   - Identify any inconsistencies or anti-patterns
   - Suggest improvements for the repository interfaces and implementations

2. **Code Structure**:
   - Assess the overall architecture and organization
   - Identify any violations of clean architecture principles
   - Suggest improvements for package organization

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Review error handling patterns
   - Identify potential error leaks or missing error checks
   - Suggest improvements for error handling

4. **Transaction Management**:
   - Evaluate the transaction handling across repositories
   - Identify potential issues with transaction propagation
   - Suggest improvements for transaction management

5. **Security**:
   - Identify any security vulnerabilities
   - Suggest improvements for secure coding practices

## Output Format
Please provide a comprehensive audit report with:

1. **Executive Summary**: A high-level overview of findings
2. **Detailed Findings**: Categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable recommendations for improvement
4. **Code Examples**: Where applicable, provide code examples for recommended changes

## Additional Notes
- Focus on the backend Go code only
- Prioritize architectural and design issues over minor style issues
- Consider both maintainability and performance implications
